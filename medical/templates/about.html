        <p>The Online Medical Store System is specially designed for online order of medicine. 
            It gives facility to customer to choose items they wish and place an order for home delivery. 
            Like every other e-commerce platform, allows customers of the website to temporarily store their chosen medicine or
            products in a cart for later checkout.Hospital Management System is a system enabling hospitals to manage information and data 
            related to all aspects of healthcare – processes, providers, patients, and more, which in turn ensures that processes are 
            completed swiftly and effectively. When one thinks of the various aspects and departments of a hospital, it becomes apparent that 
            an HMS is critical. The hospital database management system was introduced in 1960, and has greatly evolved since then – with the 
            ability to integrate with the existing facilities, technologies, software, and systems of a hospital. Today, patients can begin the
            process of healthcare in the palm of their hand – the mobile devices and apps – make this possible. This process then moves to the
            healthcare providers and hospitals.With the large amounts of data, people involved and innumerable processes, a hospital is definitely an ideal candidate for data management software. If hospitals are to run efficiently, provide top line care, ensure patient and other data confidentiality, and work seamlessly – they cannot hope to do so without an effective Hospital Management System Software. Reduced human intervention for paperwork, less paperwork, reduced staff headcount for jobs that can be easily managed within the HMS, speedier processes, reduction of errors, and data privacy and safety –
            are just some of the benefits of a Hospital Management System.

          <h1>Key features of a Hospital Management System</h1>
Operation Theatre Management:
Surgeries are long and tedious and a hospital must know the schedule of surgeries, to avoid overbooking and ensure availability of the required surgeons, other doctors and operation theatre staff. A hospital would be able to send operation schedules, test results, and other details to patients/next of kin, while also sending reminders to the presiding surgeon and other staff required for a procedure.
<br>
Lab Management:
Maintain accurate accounts of tests, payments received, report generation dates, patient information, customized reports, timely notifications to patients and laboratory staff, and detailed MIS reports – all through one Hospital Management System.
<br>
Patient Management:
With faster, secure, and easy data retrieval, a hospital/healthcare facility would be able to provide better and efficient care to the patients. With every department interconnected and integrated into the HMS, the quality of patient care can be enhanced, leading to greater customer satisfaction and lowered turnovers. Today there is severe competition even in the realm of healthcare, 
and patients and their kin prefer to visit a facility that is efficient, cost-effective, and secure.
<br>
Supply Management:
With efficient hospital management systems (HMS), hospital management can track and manage supplies more efficiently and set up better purchasing contracts with suppliers. The system provides you with full transparency of inventory from the time it was ordered to when it was brought in to when it was used on patients. This, you can better capture demand, purchase, and consumption activity, allowing you to make continuous improvements to your healthcare supply chain.
<br>
Billing Management:
Given the large numbers (in all respects) that any hospital needs to manage, a great feature of Hospital Management System is to help keep track of billing aligned with treatments, tests, and doctor fee. The system is able to send out messages for bill payment, display discounts, automatically capture patient data, provide several payment options to patients/kin, and keep a track of patient visits and payments.
